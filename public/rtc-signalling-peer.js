/*
Signalling over WebSockets:

WebSocket makes logical sense for signalling, but the word on the Web seems to be that it does not scale well.
1. Client is limited to about 200 WebSockets per server/page (browser-specific). This implementation works around
   that by multiplexing communications for all RTCSignallingPeer instances over a single WebSocket per page,
   rather than having the page open a socket for each RTCSignllingPeer that it will interact with.
2. Server is limited to about 1000 WebSockets. Since either client of a pair might need to resignal, both ends
   have to keep their WebSockets open the whole time that they use the RTCPeerConnection, even if there is no
   traffic. So, we would need concurrency/1000 servers, and a message buss between servers (to route messages
   from a client on one server to the correct server for the other client.
3. Front end / load balancers / reverse proxies (such as NGINX) typically work at the HTTP level, not the
   the TCP level that WebSockets operate at, so it may be difficult or impossible for such to provide their
   benefits with WebSockets. My guess is that this may be true of client-side forward proxies as well, which may
   matter for mobile.
4. HTTP/2 has significant scaling advantages, but isn't compatible with WebSockets.
5. Mobile devices and carriers don't like to leave sockets open indefinitely. (SSE, below, behaves similarly to
   the various proprietary mechanism to push an event to a mobile device, and so is more likely to be adaptable.)
Thus WebSockets may ultimately be a dead end. Nonetheless, they're familiar, so the following provides a sample
client use. 

The server at this site provides a simple service like the following, meant to illustrate how the multiplexing works:

const wss = new require('ws').Server({ server }), wsRegistrants = {};
wss.on('connection', function (ws, req) {
    const url = new URL(req.url, CANONICAL_HOST), id = url.pathname.slice(1);
    wsRegistrants[id] = ws;
    ws.on('message', function (data) {
        const message = JSON.parse(data), destination = wsRegistrants[message.to];
        if (id !== message.from) return ws.terminate();
        if (!destination) return ws.terminate(); // Just close the connection, just as if client were directly connected to the destination.
        destination.send(data);
    });
    ws.on('close', function () { delete wsRegistrants[id]; });
});

Example use in browser:
const ourId = 'A', peerId = 'B', ws = new WebSocket(`wss://${host}/${ourId}`);
ws.onopen = _ => { const connection = new WebSocketRTC(ws, ourId, peerId); ..... }
*/

class WebSocketRTC extends RTCSignallingPeer {
    constructor(webSocket, ourId, peerId, iceServers = null, peerConstraints = null) {
        super(ourId, peerId, iceServers, peerConstraints);
        this.webSocket = webSocket;
        // Each WebSocketRTC adds it's own listener to the shared webSocket, each of which ignores messages
        // that are not for it. (Yes, each one is parsing the message, but by using WebSockets, the
        // the scalability ship has already sailed.)
        webSocket.addEventListener('message', messageEvent => { // When is the handler gc'd?
            const message = JSON.parse(messageEvent.data);
            if (message.from !== this.peerId) return;
            this[message.type](message.data);
        });
    }
    p2pSend(type, message) { // Create json message with metadata and send it up the socket.
        this.webSocket.send(JSON.stringify({type: type, from: this.id, to: this.peerId, data: message}));
    }

/*
Signalling with ordinary GET to send messages, and Server-Side Events to receive them.  

Use of this class in the browser is similar to above:
const ourId = 'A', peerId = 'B', sse = new EventSource(`/messages?id=${ourId}`);
ws.onopen = _ => { const connection = new EventSourceRTC(ws, ourId, peerId); ..... }

The server provides two endpoints:
  /messages?id=X - Pushes responses providing typed messageEvents on the EventSource. 
                   The forwarder below attaches to the signalling events and checks that they
                   are from our peer.
  /message?type=W&to=X&from=Y&data=Z - Server routes the data to X's event source.

class EventSourceRTC extends RTCSignallingPeer {

        this.events.forEach(type => eventSource.addEventListener(type, this.forwarder.bind(this)));
