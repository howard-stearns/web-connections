/*
Signaling over WebSockets:

WebSocket makes logical sense for signaling, but the word on the Web seems to be that it does not scale well.
1. Client is limited to about 200 WebSockets per server/page (browser-specific). This implementation works around
   that by multiplexing communications for all RTCSignalingPeer instances over a single WebSocket per page,
   rather than having the page open a socket for each RTCSignllingPeer that it will interact with.
2. Server is limited to about 1000 WebSockets. Since either client of a pair might need to resignal, both ends
   have to keep their WebSockets open the whole time that they use the RTCPeerConnection, even if there is no
   traffic. So, we would need concurrency/1000 servers, and a message buss between servers (to route messages
   from a client on one server to the correct server for the other client.
3. Front end / load balancers / reverse proxies (such as NGINX) typically work at the HTTP level, not the
   TCP level that WebSockets operate at, so it may be difficult or impossible for such to provide their
   benefits with WebSockets. My guess is that this may be true of client-side forward proxies as well, which may
   matter for mobile.
4. HTTP/2 has significant scaling advantages, but isn't compatible with WebSockets.
5. Mobile devices and carriers don't like to leave sockets open indefinitely. (SSE, below, behaves similarly to
   the various proprietary mechanism to push an event to a mobile device, and so is more likely to be adaptable.)
Thus WebSockets may ultimately be a dead end in industry. Nonetheless, they're familiar, so the following provides a sample
client use.
